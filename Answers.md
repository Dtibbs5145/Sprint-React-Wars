1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React was done first on Facebook so it would be faster, reusesble, and more scaleable. React allows for hooks such as useState and useEffect.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in react means breaking components down, figuring out where you want the state to be and then adding the code and connecting the data.

1. Describe state.

State is the data and is called state only in the main component.

1. Describe props.

When you bring the state to other components, you bring them over as props.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are anything that is used outside of the scope of the function and you can use useEffect to give access to the state and props.
